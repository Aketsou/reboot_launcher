# Reboot Launcher

Developed by Auties00

The main page

### Username input

Pretty easy to use, just write the name that you want people to see in game. It will automatically change based on the state of the host switch that you can see in the same page. This is done because, as the launcher supports friends, you probably want different usernames. Anyways they will be memorized and change as I just wrote based on the host switch.

### Version Selector

Just use it to select a Fortnite version to launch, if you have none use the first button to the right if you already have the one you need installed on your pc(Add a local build) or the second to the right if you need to install it from the cloud(Download a build).

### Add a local build

It's the first button to the right of the version selector, you can use it add a Fortnite build that you already have on the launcher

### Download a build

It's the second button to the right of the version selector in the home, you can use it to download practically any Fortnite build that exists.
Builds marked as "Fortnite Manifest" are very fast to download and can be downloaded freely.
Builds marked as "Google Drive" are slower to download as the file has to be unarchived. Also if you download too many builds in a very short amount of time Google may rate limit you(error code 429).
Some google builds may be unavailable temporarily(status code 404).
In conclusion if you have to download a build, prefer the ones marked as "Fortnite Manifest"

### Launch / Close

Use this button to launch the game. Then click it again when it says close to close the game. Remember this last part because some goofy ass actually asked me why the game was crashing, plot twist: they were closing the game.

### Host Switch

Whether the reboot.dll should be injected for you to be able to host games. If not on, you will be instead able to play games

## Server page

Pretty much don't touch this except you really know what you are doing



### Host

The host of the remote server to use for the lawin server. Only enabled if you are not using the embedded server.

### Port

The port of the remote server to use for the lawin server. Only enabled if you are not using the embedded server.

### Embedded

A switch to determine whether an embedded lawin server should be used or if you want to use a remote one

### Check address / Start or Stop server

If the embedded switch is off, this button checks that the remote server actually works. If it's on, instead, it will start or stop the lawin server. If you click on the launch button in the launcher page, the server will automatically start if you are using the embedded server and if it's not already running. If the 3551 port is already in use on your pc, the launcher will tell you and provide an option to stop the associated process automatically.
